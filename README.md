# PERN-todo-list

This app is a simple To-do List using the PERN stack (PostgresQL, Express, React, Node). The table setup was done using Bootstrap 4. 
It utilizes a simple API with that holds the following information: id and description. 
The app follows CRUD methodology (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for an easy user experience.
The Update feature uses a modal function, and was created using Bootstrap 4. 

I hope you enjoy using this app.
